# CurrentCustomers

## Python script for processing customer exports from AS400

## Notes:

### AS400 Dates
These are some odd thought up dates from the system

Essentially the work like

```
980101 = January 01, 1998
```

```
1140101 = January 01, 2014
```

The additional `1` on the front of the date as an integer represents the 21st century.

Dates from the 20th century do not have anything.
